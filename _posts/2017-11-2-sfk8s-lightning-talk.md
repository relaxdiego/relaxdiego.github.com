Here's my lightning talk from last September's SF Kubernetes Meetup.
Thanks to [Stack Point Cloud](https://stackpoint.io/), [Bitnami](https://bitnami.com/),
and [Weave Works](https://www.weave.works/) for making this event happen!

UPDATE: Since that lightning talk, we've moved away from the VM-based
setup and started investigating other methods that still satisfy the
3 hard requirements mentioned in the talk.
