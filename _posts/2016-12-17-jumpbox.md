Have your ever had to log in to your cluster on EC2 to troubleshoot some
problem but then needed to collaborate with one or two teammates who are
in another location, probably working from home because it's a Friday and
they wanted to get a head start on their beer time (not that I do that. No.
Never). I know, there's Screen. But it can only do so much. What if you
need to manage who can and cannot log in to the cluster? What if you need
to revoke access to one or more (former) team mates?

Well, you're in luck! Here's how you can solve pair programming/devopsing
across georgraphical locations! Introducing [Jumpbox](https://github.com/relaxdiego/jumpbox):
