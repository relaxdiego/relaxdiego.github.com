I am a software engineer who has been working in a DevOps environment 
since 2008 contributing my knowledge on sound software engineering 
practices to my Ops colleagues while sharing what I know about the big 
picture of software delivery to my Dev colleagues. I enjoy what I do 
because I get to contribute by a significant portion to the delivery of 
awesome software solutions.


== Accomplishments

- *Increased billing module accuracy and speed by at least 10x* - When a
product's billing module was producing inaccurate results and regularly
timing out, I offered to inspect the code and find out where the problem
lay. After much debugging, I found the problem and provided a fix which
resulted in the reports displaying correctly. To improve the speed, however,
required re-architecting the module which I led from conception to delivery.

- *Facilitated the timely delivery of software by automating requirements* -
We needed to deliver a software agent for a customer that needed their 
product to work with a 3rd-party vendor's product. I volunteered to study 
the associated open standards and proprietary protocol to learn about the 
requirements. I then codified these requirements in a test harness that 
also doubled as the executable requirements document for the development 
team. After integrating this into our CI/CD pipeline, the dev team was able 
to receive timely feedback on requirements compliance and regressions allowing 
them to deliver on time and within budget!

- *Deployed an HA container orchestration platform to replace CI/CD* - 
I have been following containerization since the initial Docker days even 
though it was outside my job description. Because of my skunkworks preparation, 
I was later able to build an Ansible-based project that provisioned an HA 
OpenShift/Kubernetes environment as a means to replace our internal 
CI/CD pipeline as well as an environment to deploy our internal apps.

- *Talked at various meetups and conferences* - I've presented on various topics
such as https://www.ansible.com/writing-fully-tested-ansible-modules-for-fun-and-profit[How 
to Write Fully-Tested Ansible Modules] (AnsibleFest NY 2016),
https://www.openstack.org/summit/openstack-summit-atlanta-2014/session-videos/presentation/multi-node-devstack-with-puppet[Multi-node 
DevStack with Puppet] (OpenStack Summit Atlanta 2014), and
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18O8BVqNSCM5Q2x492AP9njom_l_CKJ_ak9SzNtQACV0/edit?usp=sharing[How 
I Built My Own BDD Framework] (Ruby on Rails Meetup, Los Angeles 2013)

- *Reduced a 2-day manual process to 5 seconds* - While building the MIS for
a metal fabrication shop, I learned about a manual process that took shop
engineers 2 days to complete. After some research, I was able to build a
desktop app that reduced the computation time to 5 seconds.

- *Improved requirements gathering through prototyping* - Upon joining a new
software consulting firm, I noticed the long feedback loop from requirements
gathering to user testing. I encouraged and guided my teammates to adopt
prototyping as one of the ways to improve requirements gathering and reduce
waste. The results were positive and the engineers along with the users were
very happy with the results.

- *Recipient of academic excellence award for best strategic plan* - I wanted
to understand the business of software and decided that focusing on the basics of
business management was key. I then applied for our state university's graduate
program for management where I was accepted. During the program, I was top of
class for Operations Management, Financial Management, and Business Strategy. I
then used everything that I learned to create a strategic plan for our family
business which resulted in me getting the academic excellence award for best
strategic plan.

- *Can solve Rubik's Cube in 1 minute 25 seconds* - Not a record shattering feat
but it's one of my best times. I decided to learn to solve the cube because it
was interesting. https://youtu.be/3zh-ORAndw8[Video on YouTube].

== A Few Open Source Projects

- *Open vSwitch Lab* - A Vagrant project which provisions two machines that talk
over a simulated Internet. The lab is a companion project for the series of
articles I wrote about http://www.relaxdiego.com/2014/09/ovs-lab.html[VXLAN], 
http://www.relaxdiego.com/2014/09/ovsdb.html[OVSDB], and 
http://www.relaxdiego.com/2014/09/hardware_vtep.html[the hardware VTEP schema]. 
https://github.com/relaxdiego/ovs-lab[Source in Github].

- *Aviator* - A lightweight Ruby client library for cloud REST APIs. I initially
built this for the OpenStack API. My focus was to build a library that reflected,
rather than obscured the underlying API. http://aviator.github.io/www/[Homepage].

- *Mana Mana* - A proof-of-concept business natural language testing framework
that was inspired by Cucumber and the Robot framework. This was borne out of my
never-ending search for better ways to write maintainable automated tests.

- *Others* - I also contribute to other open source projects and you will usually
find it in my https://github.com/relaxdiego[activity feed on Github]


== One More Thing

Coding without tests is like driving a Tesla in ludicrous mode *without seatbelts* 
so I always make sure to cover my code with a reasonable amount of tests. Here's
